# Hotel Reservation System
Our major course outputs for CCPROG3.

`Driver.java` is for our first major course output, which was to implement the reservation system in the terminal.
`View.java` and `ViewController.java` are for our second major course output, which was to implement the same system in a Swing GUI.
